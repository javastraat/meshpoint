# Meshpoint Onboarding Guide

Step-by-step instructions for building and deploying a Meshpoint: from an empty Raspberry Pi to a fully operational node feeding data to the Meshradar cloud platform.

---

## What You're Building

A **Meshpoint** is an edge device that:

- Listens to **Meshtastic** traffic on one tuned frequency with **SF7-SF12
  decoded in parallel** (eight SX1302 demod chains) via an SX1302/SX1303
  concentrator
- **Sends and receives Meshtastic messages** directly from the browser dashboard (native TX via the concentrator)
- Optionally monitors **MeshCore** traffic via a USB companion radio
- Decodes, stores, and visualizes packets on a real-time dashboard with full chat UI, node discovery, and radio configuration
- Ships data upstream to the [Meshradar](https://meshradar.io) cloud platform for regional mesh intelligence

## Choose your path: Gateway or Node

Most Meshpoints are **gateways**: a Raspberry Pi plus an **SX1302 or SX1303
concentrator** (RAK Hotspot V2, SenseCap M1, Syncrobit Chameleon, or DIY
RAK2287). That is what the rest of this guide covers. Install from **`main`**
(Stable) after cloning the repo.

**Node (experimental):** If you have a **RAK6421 WisMesh Pi HAT** on a Pi 4 with a **RAK13300** or **RAK13302** LoRa WisBlock module (slot 1), and want Meshpoint's dashboard without an SX1302 gateway stack, use the experimental **`feat/wismesh-hat`** track instead. It runs **meshtasticd** for RF and is **not** for concentrator gateways.

| **Gateway** (recommended) | SX1302/SX1303 concentrator | `main` | Continue below |
| **Node** (experimental) | RAK6421 HAT + RAK13300/13302 | `feat/wismesh-hat` | [WisMesh Node guide](WISMESH-NODE.md) |

## Hardware Requirements

You need a Raspberry Pi 4 or Compute Module 4 host with an SX1302 or SX1303 LoRa
concentrator. The easiest paths are buying a pre-built unit (RAK Hotspot V2,
SenseCap M1, or Syncrobit Chameleon) and installing Meshpoint. SD-based miners
use Raspberry Pi Imager; the Chameleon uses onboard eMMC and a one-time USB
flash (see [Syncrobit Chameleon guide](SYNCROBIT-CHAMELEON.md)).

| Component | Purpose | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Raspberry Pi 4** (1-2GB RAM) | Host computer | 1GB works, 2GB recommended for future updates |
| **SX1302/SX1303 Concentrator** | Multi-channel LoRa RX + TX | RAK2287 (SX1302) or Seeed WM1303 (SX1303) |
| **Carrier board / Pi HAT** | Mounts the concentrator to the Pi | RAK Pi HAT, SenseCap M1 carrier, or WM1302 Pi HAT |
| **microSD card** (32GB) | Boot drive | Class 10 or better |
| **USB-C power supply** (5V 3A) | Power | Official Pi PSU recommended |
| **LoRa antenna** (906 MHz) | RX + TX | 10 dBi gain recommended for US915 band |
| **Ethernet cable or WiFi** | Network connectivity | Needed for cloud uplink |
| **Optional: MeshCore USB companion** | MeshCore traffic monitor | Heltec V3/V4 or T-Beam with [USB companion firmware](https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk/) |

### Supported Pre-Built Units

| Unit | Concentrator | Price Range | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **RAK Hotspot V2** (RAK7248) | RAK2287 (SX1302) | $30-70 on eBay | Pi 4 + metal enclosure + antenna, usually 32GB SD card (more than enough for our usage) |
| **SenseCap M1** | WM1303 (SX1303) | $30-60 on eBay | Pi 4 + metal enclosure + antenna, may include 64GB SD card |
| **Syncrobit Chameleon** | SX1302 (onboard) | Varies | CM4 eMMC + enclosure; often PoE. [USB eMMC flash guide](SYNCROBIT-CHAMELEON.md) |

> **RAK2287 vs SenseCap M1:** The RAK2287's SPI bus can latch if power is cut while the concentrator is active. The Meshpoint service includes a GPIO reset script that holds the concentrator in reset during shutdown, making `sudo reboot` and `sudo systemctl restart meshpoint` safe. However, hard power loss (yanked cable, power outage) can still latch the SPI bus — requiring a full power unplug (10+ seconds) to clear. Repeated hard power loss can permanently damage the SX1250 radio. The SenseCap M1 does not have this issue. For deployments with unreliable power, the **SenseCap M1 is recommended**, or add a small UPS (PiSugar, USB battery with passthrough).

RAK Hotspot V2: remove 4 bottom screws to access the SD card. SenseCap M1: remove 2 screws on the back panel (opposite the Ethernet/antenna ports) -- the SD card may be held down with kapton tape. Chameleon: no SD slot; see [Syncrobit Chameleon guide](SYNCROBIT-CHAMELEON.md).

## Prerequisites

- A computer with an SD card reader (for Pi 4 / SD-based miners) **or** a Linux PC with USB for CM4 eMMC recovery (Chameleon)
- SSH client (PuTTY on Windows, or built-in terminal on Mac/Linux)
- A [Meshradar](https://meshradar.io) account (free: create one before starting)

---

## Syncrobit Chameleon (CM4 eMMC)

The Chameleon has **no microSD slot**. Use the dedicated
[Syncrobit Chameleon guide](SYNCROBIT-CHAMELEON.md) for USB eMMC recovery,
`install.sh`, and moving the CM4 into the miner enclosure. After Meshpoint is
running, continue below at [Step 7: Get Your API Key](#step-7-get-your-api-key)
if you still need the wizard and cloud steps.

---

## DIY Setup (Building Your Own)

### Step 1: Flash Raspberry Pi OS

1. Download [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) on your computer.

2. Insert the microSD card.

3. Open Raspberry Pi Imager and choose:
   - **OS**: Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) -- the headless version without a desktop
   - **Storage**: Your microSD card

4. Click the gear icon (or Ctrl+Shift+X) to open **Advanced Options**:
   - **Enable SSH**: Check the box, select "Use password authentication"
   - **Set username and password**: Choose a username (e.g. `pi`) and a strong password
   - **Configure WiFi** (if not using Ethernet): Enter your SSID and password
   - **Set locale**: Choose your timezone and keyboard layout

5. Click **Write** and wait for it to finish.

6. Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi. Do **not** power it on yet.

> **Enclosed units:** RAK Hotspot V2 -- remove 4 bottom screws. SenseCap M1 -- remove 2 screws on the back panel (opposite the Ethernet/antenna ports); SD card may be taped down with kapton tape. After flashing, re-insert the card and reassemble.

### Step 2: Assemble Hardware

**If using a pre-built unit (RAK Hotspot V2 or SenseCap M1):** The concentrator is already seated. Just connect the LoRa antenna to the SMA connector and insert the flashed SD card. For SenseCap M1, USB-C power plugs into the carrier board (not the Pi's own USB-C port).

**If using a Syncrobit Chameleon:** Follow [Syncrobit Chameleon guide](SYNCROBIT-CHAMELEON.md) first. The concentrator is already on the board; antenna and PoE only after OS + Meshpoint are installed.

**If building from parts:**

1. Seat the concentrator module (RAK2287 or WM1303) into the mPCIe slot on the carrier board.
2. Connect the LoRa antenna to the SMA port. **Never power the concentrator without an antenna connected** -- this can damage the radio.
3. If your carrier board has a GPS module and you have a GPS antenna, connect it to the u.FL connector.
4. Mount the carrier board onto the Raspberry Pi's GPIO header.
5. If using a MeshCore USB companion, connect it to one of the Pi's USB ports.
6. Connect Ethernet (if not using WiFi).
7. Connect the power supply.

### Step 3: Find the Pi on Your Network

The Pi should boot and connect to your network within 1-2 minutes.

**Option A: Check your router's DHCP client list** for a device named `raspberrypi` (or whatever hostname you set).

**Option B: Use `nmap` from your computer:**

```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```

Replace `192.168.1.0/24` with your local subnet.

### Step 4: SSH into the Pi

```bash
ssh pi@<your-pi-ip-address>
```

Enter the password you set during imaging.

### Step 5: Clone and Install

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git
sudo git clone https://github.com/javastraat/meshpoint.git /opt/meshpoint
sudo bash /opt/meshpoint/scripts/install.sh
```

The install script handles everything: system packages, SPI/UART/GPS kernel configuration, building the LoRa concentrator driver with Meshtastic TX patches, Python virtual environment, dependencies, systemd service, and permissions setup.

This takes 5-15 minutes depending on your internet speed and Pi model.

> **WisMesh Node (RAK6421 HAT, experimental):** Documented on `main` (see [README Option E](../README.md#option-e-wismesh-node-rak6421-hat-experimental) and [Hardware Matrix](HARDWARE-MATRIX.md#wismesh-node-rak6421-hat-experimental)). Software is on branch **`feat/wismesh-hat`** until v0.7.6: use `sudo bash /opt/meshpoint/scripts/install.sh --platform node` instead of the gateway install above. The Node installer configures **meshtasticd** and installs the bundled **RAK13302 1W** LoRa preset by default (standard for WisBlock slot 1). See [`docs/plans/WISMESH-BRANCH.md`](plans/WISMESH-BRANCH.md).

### Step 6: Reboot

The SPI and UART kernel changes require a reboot:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Wait 30-60 seconds, then SSH back in.

### Step 7: Get Your API Key

1. Go to [meshradar.io](https://meshradar.io) in your browser
2. Sign up and verify your email
3. Go to **Account > API Keys**
4. Click **Generate New Key**
5. **Copy the key immediately** -- it is only shown once

### Step 8: Run the Setup Wizard

```bash
sudo meshpoint setup
```

> **Note:** `sudo` is required — the wizard writes to `/opt/meshpoint/config/local.yaml` which is owned by root.

The wizard walks you through these steps:

1. **Hardware Detection** -- probes for concentrator, carrier board, GPS, serial radios, USB MeshCore devices
2. **Frequency Region** -- select your Meshtastic region (US, EU_868, ANZ, IN, KR, SG_923). The concentrator auto-tunes to the correct frequency
3. **Capture Source** -- auto-selects concentrator, serial, or mock. If a MeshCore USB companion is detected, offers to enable it and configure its radio frequency to match your region
4. **MQTT** -- optional MQTT publishing to community brokers and Home Assistant
5. **API Key** -- paste your Meshradar API key
6. **Device Name** -- give it a recognizable name (e.g. "Meshpoint Rooftop")
7. **Location** -- use GPS fix or enter lat/lng manually (right-click Google Maps to copy)
8. **Node Identity** -- a unique random Meshtastic node ID, long name, and short name are auto-generated. You can customize these later from the Radio settings page on the dashboard
9. **Device ID** -- auto-generated unique identifier for cloud registration

The wizard writes `config/local.yaml` and offers to start the service.

> **After setup:** TX is disabled by default. Enable it from the dashboard Radio settings page once you've verified RX is working.

### Step 9: Verify It's Working

```bash
meshpoint status
```

Check the local dashboard at `http://<your-pi-ip>:8080`. You should see:
- **Map** showing your device's location and discovered nodes
- **Packet feed** with live Meshtastic and MeshCore traffic (once LoRa devices are in range)
- **Messaging tab** for sending and receiving Meshtastic messages (enable TX in Radio settings first)
- **Nodes grid** with cards for every discovered node: name, signal, hardware, battery
- **Radio settings** page to configure region, modem preset, frequency, TX, and channels
- **Signal charts** and traffic analytics
- **System metrics**: CPU, RAM, disk, temperature

Check the cloud dashboard at [meshradar.io](https://meshradar.io). Your Meshpoint should appear as a green dot in the fleet view within a minute.

## Adding a MeshCore Companion (Optional)

A MeshCore USB companion gives your Meshpoint the ability to monitor MeshCore mesh traffic alongside Meshtastic. It's a single-channel radio that listens on one frequency -- all standard MeshCore traffic in your region uses the same frequency, so the regional preset covers everything.

### What You Need

A Heltec or T-Beam board flashed with **USB Serial Companion** firmware. Supported devices include:

| Device | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Heltec LoRa V3 | ESP32-S3, common and inexpensive |
| Heltec LoRa V4 / V4 OLED | ESP32-S3, latest Heltec revision |
| LilyGo T-Beam | ESP32, includes GPS |
| Heltec Wireless Tracker | ESP32-S3, includes GPS and display |

### Step 1: Flash USB Companion Firmware

1. Go to [flasher.meshcore.co.uk](https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk/) in a Chrome or Edge browser
2. Select your device model
3. Choose the **`companion_radio_usb`** firmware variant (not BLE)
4. Connect the device via USB and click Flash

> **Important:** The USB companion firmware disables Bluetooth. Radio parameters (frequency, bandwidth, etc.) can only be configured over serial -- either through the Meshpoint setup wizard or manually via Python. The setup wizard handles this automatically.

### Step 2: Plug Into the Pi and Run Setup

1. Connect the flashed device to any USB port on the Raspberry Pi
2. Run the setup wizard:

```bash
sudo meshpoint setup
```

3. The wizard detects the MeshCore device and asks if you want to enable monitoring
4. The wizard auto-configures the companion's radio frequency based on your selected region:

| Region | Frequency | BW | SF | CR |
|--------|-----------|-----|-----|-----|
| US | 910.525 MHz | 62.5 kHz | 7 | 5 |
| EU | 869.618 MHz | 62.5 kHz | 8 | 8 |
| ANZ | 916.575 MHz | 62.5 kHz | 7 | 8 |

Other regions prompt for custom frequency entry. You can also change the MeshCore radio frequency anytime with `meshpoint meshcore-radio`.

5. The wizard sets the radio parameters, reboots the companion, and verifies the new settings

After setup, both capture sources start automatically on boot. You'll see them in the startup banner:

```
Source  concentrator (SX1302), MeshCore USB node
```

### Changing MeshCore Radio Frequency

To switch the MeshCore companion to a different region without re-running the full setup wizard:

```bash
meshpoint meshcore-radio         # interactive menu (US, EU, ANZ, Custom)
meshpoint meshcore-radio EU      # apply EU preset directly
meshpoint meshcore-radio custom  # enter manual frequency/BW/SF/CR
```

The command auto-detects the USB port, stops the service, configures the radio, waits for the companion to reboot, updates the config if the USB port changed, and restarts the service.

### How It Differs from the Concentrator

| | SX1302/SX1303 Concentrator | MeshCore USB Companion |
|---|---|---|
| **Protocol** | Meshtastic | MeshCore |
| **Direction** | RX + TX (native) | RX + TX (via companion) |
| **Channels** | SF7-SF12 parallel (one RF plan) | 1 |
| **Spreading factors** | SF7-SF12 all at once | Fixed (SF7 default) |
| **Connection** | SPI (internal HAT) | USB serial |
| **Configuration** | Dashboard Radio settings | Region preset via wizard |

## Enabling the SenseCap M1 Onboard Fan (Optional)

The SenseCap M1 has an onboard fan header, an LED, and a user button on GPIO 13, 22, and 27 respectively (BCM numbering, confirmed live via `scripts/test_gpio_hardware.py` -- no public schematic exists for this board, so these were found by testing rather than documented anywhere). Meshpoint can drive the fan proportionally from CPU temperature (PWM, not just on/off) -- useful in hot weather so it isn't either silent-and-overheating or full-speed-and-loud all the time. This hardware doesn't exist on RAK V2, Chameleon, or DIY builds, so it's opt-in and does nothing unless enabled.

### Step 1: Install the GPIO Backend

`gpiozero` and `lgpio` aren't part of the base install (most Meshpoint hardware doesn't need GPIO control at all). `lgpio` specifically needs three system packages to build from source -- there's no prebuilt wheel for every Pi/Python combination:

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3-dev swig liblgpio-dev
sudo /opt/meshpoint/venv/bin/pip install gpiozero lgpio
```

Without `lgpio` (or `RPi.GPIO`/`pigpio`), gpiozero falls back to a pure-Python pin factory that refuses PWM on this board's repurposed GPIO 13 (`PinPWMUnsupported`), even though it's a genuine PWM-capable pin on the Pi 4 SoC underneath.

### Step 2: Enable It in `local.yaml`

```yaml
fan:
  enabled: true
```

That line alone is enough -- every other setting (`gpio_pin`, `min_temp_c`, `max_temp_c`, `min_duty`, `hysteresis_c`, `poll_interval_s`) has a working default, all documented with inline comments in `config/default.yaml` if you want to tune the temperature range or ramp behaviour. Full reference: `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` → "Fan Control (SenseCap M1)".

### Step 3: Restart

```bash
sudo systemctl restart meshpoint
```

Check `meshpoint logs` for:

```
fan_control: Fan control started on GPIO13 (45-65C range, poll every 10s)
```

If you're upgrading an existing install rather than doing a fresh `install.sh` run, also make sure `/opt/meshpoint` itself (not just `config/`/`data/`) is owned by the `meshpoint` service user -- `lgpio` writes a notification pipe directly into the working directory, and older deployments only chowned the subdirectories:

```bash
sudo chown meshpoint:meshpoint /opt/meshpoint
```

Current `scripts/meshpoint.service` does this automatically on every start, so this is only needed once if your live systemd unit predates that fix. See `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for the full failure-mode-by-failure-mode breakdown if any of these steps don't go cleanly.

## Pre-Provisioned Device (Received from Someone)

If you received a pre-built Meshpoint, all the software is already configured. You just need to set it up physically.

### What's in the Box

- Raspberry Pi 4 with LoRa concentrator HAT mounted (RAK2287 or WM1303)
- LoRa antenna
- USB-C power supply
- microSD card (already inserted and configured)

### Setup

1. **Connect the antenna** to the gold SMA connector on the HAT. Do this BEFORE powering on.
2. **Plug in the Ethernet cable** (if provided) or the device is pre-configured for your Wi-Fi.
3. **Plug in the USB-C power supply.**

The device will boot in about 60 seconds and start capturing LoRa packets automatically.

> **Shutting down:** If you ever need to unplug the device, **always** run `sudo poweroff` first (via SSH) and wait for the green LED to stop blinking. Never yank the power cable while the Pi is running -- this can corrupt the SD card and permanently damage the concentrator radio.

### Accessing Your Local Dashboard

Once the device is on your network, open a browser and go to:

```
http://<device-ip>:8080
```

To find the device IP, check your router's DHCP client list for the device name (e.g. "meshpoint-nyc").

### What You'll See

- **Packet Feed** -- real-time Meshtastic and MeshCore packets from your area
- **Messaging** -- send and receive messages on the mesh (if TX is enabled)
- **Node Cards** -- every discovered node with name, signal, hardware, battery
- **Node Map** -- discovered mesh nodes plotted on a map
- **Radio Settings** -- configure region, modem preset, frequency, TX, and channels
- **Signal Charts** -- RSSI distribution and traffic over time
- **Device Metrics** -- CPU, RAM, disk usage, temperature

The device also sends data to the Meshradar cloud platform. Your device operator can see your Meshpoint status and metrics from the cloud dashboard.

### Troubleshooting

- **No packets appearing**: Make sure the antenna is connected and there are Meshtastic/Meshcore devices transmitting in your area.
- **Can't find the device on your network**: Check your router for the device hostname, or try `nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24` from your computer.
- **Dashboard not loading**: Wait 60 seconds after power-on for the service to fully start.

## Managing Your Meshpoint

### CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `meshpoint status` | Show device health, uptime, and connection status |
| `meshpoint logs` | Tail the live service logs |
| `meshpoint report` | Full operational report: traffic, signal, system metrics |
| `meshpoint restart` | Restart the service (applies config changes) |
| `meshpoint stop` | Stop the service |
| `meshpoint meshcore-radio` | Configure MeshCore companion radio frequency |
| `sudo meshpoint setup` | Re-run the setup wizard (overwrites config) |
| `meshpoint version` | Print firmware version |
| `sudo poweroff` | Shut down safely before unplugging power |

> **Always shut down before unplugging.** Run `sudo poweroff` and wait for the green LED to stop before pulling the cable. Reboots (`sudo reboot`) are safe.

### Editing Configuration

Most settings can now be changed from the **Radio settings** page on the dashboard: region, modem preset, frequency, TX power, channels, and node identity. Changes save to `local.yaml` automatically.

For advanced settings not exposed in the UI, edit the file directly:

```bash
sudo nano /opt/meshpoint/config/local.yaml
meshpoint restart
```

Default settings are in `config/default.yaml`: do not edit that file.

### Updating

Use this block for any upgrade (v0.6.x through current). `install.sh` is idempotent on existing installs.

```bash
cd /opt/meshpoint
sudo git fetch origin
sudo git checkout main
sudo git pull origin main
sudo bash scripts/install.sh
sudo systemctl restart meshpoint
```

The local dashboard shows an orange update indicator when a new version is available on GitHub.

> **Hard-refresh the browser after every update.** The dashboard SPA is heavily cached. After `systemctl restart meshpoint`, press Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R on macOS) on each open dashboard tab so the browser pulls the new frontend JS instead of the stale copy. Skipping this is the most common cause of "looks broken after upgrade" reports.

**First time crossing v0.7.3:** you will be redirected to `/setup` to set an admin password. v0.7.3 added `bcrypt` and `PyJWT`; the block above installs them. Recover a forgotten password with `sudo meshpoint reset-password`.

**Already on v0.7.3+:** plain `git pull` + `restart` is often enough for small releases; when unsure, use the full block. See [COMMON-ERRORS.md](COMMON-ERRORS.md#upgrades) for pull-only failure modes (stale `.so`, missing modules).

A reboot ensures all changes take effect cleanly (kernel modules, SPI state, MeshCore companion). Reboots are safe: the systemd service holds the concentrator in reset during shutdown to prevent SPI bus latch.

**If the concentrator fails to start** with `lgw_start() failed` or `Failed to set SX1250_0 in STANDBY_RC mode`, the SPI bus latched due to a hard power cut. Fix it with a full power cycle:

```bash
sudo poweroff
```

Wait for the green LED to stop blinking, then unplug for 10+ seconds and plug back in.

**Important:** Always shut down gracefully with `sudo poweroff` before unplugging. Hard power cuts (yanked cable, power outage) can corrupt the SD card and latch the RAK2287's SPI bus. Repeated hard power loss can permanently damage the SX1250 radio.

### Back up your Meshpoint

On a healthy install, use **Settings → System → Download backup** and store the `.tar.gz` on your PC or NAS (not only on the SD card). If the card fails, reinstall Meshpoint, run `sudo meshpoint setup` once so the dashboard loads, then **Restore backup** from the System page. See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#backup-before-sd-card-trouble).

For troubleshooting, corrupted install recovery, and pip issues, see [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

Each Meshpoint operates independently with its own local dashboard. When connected to the cloud, all Meshpoints contribute to a shared regional view where you can see every node and Meshpoint across the network.
