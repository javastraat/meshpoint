# Configuration Guide

All settings live in `config/default.yaml` with user overrides in `config/local.yaml`. The service merges both files at startup: anything in `local.yaml` overrides the default. You only need to add the settings you want to change.

Edit your local config:

```bash
sudo nano /opt/meshpoint/config/local.yaml
```

Restart after any config change: `sudo systemctl restart meshpoint`

### Backup and restore

**Download backup (healthy Pi):** **Settings → System → Download backup** writes a timestamped `.tar.gz` to your browser. Save it on your PC or NAS, not only on the Pi. The archive is not encrypted and contains API keys, channel PSKs, PKI private material, and your full local database.

**Restore** replaces `config/local.yaml` and resets the live `data/` tree to match the archive. Anything that happened on the Pi after that backup (including **Clear database**) is discarded. Upload staging folders (`data/restore-incoming/`) and prior `data/pre-restore-stash-*` folders are left untouched.

**Fresh SD or wiped install (typical user flow):**

1. Install Meshpoint (`git clone` + `scripts/install.sh` on the new card).
2. Run **`sudo meshpoint setup`** once and paste a valid Meshradar API key so the service can start (the dashboard does not load on a blank install without this step).
3. Open the dashboard, complete **`/setup`** for the admin password.
4. **Settings → System → Restore backup** and upload your saved `.tar.gz`.
5. After restart, sign in with your **pre-disaster** dashboard password. Confirm nodes and packets, then check upstream logs for `connected to wss://api.meshradar.io`.

**Important:** Restore puts back the API key from the backup. If you deleted that key on [meshradar.io](https://meshradar.io) after taking the backup, local data will still restore but upstream will log `HTTP 403` until you generate a new key for the same `device_id` and update it via `sudo meshpoint setup` or `upstream.auth_token` in `config/local.yaml` (there is no dashboard field for the API key yet).

Full walkthrough: [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#disaster-recovery-with-a-saved-backup-recommended). SSH-only restore: `sudo bash /opt/meshpoint/scripts/restore_finish.sh /path/to/backup.tar.gz`.

## Radio

```yaml
radio:
  region: "US"                 # US, EU_868, ANZ, IN, KR, SG_923
  frequency_mhz: 906.875       # override within region's band limits
  spreading_factor: 11         # 7-12. 11=LongFast, 9=MediumFast, 7=ShortFast/Turbo
  bandwidth_khz: 250.0         # 125, 250, or 500
  coding_rate: "4/5"           # 4/5, 4/6, 4/7, 4/8
  sync_word: 0x2B              # 0x2B = Meshtastic. Don't change unless you know why.
  preamble_length: 16          # 16 = Meshtastic standard
  tx_power_dbm: 22             # SX1302 concentrator output power
  spectral_scan_interval_seconds: 60   # noise floor sampler cadence (0 disables)
  sx1261_spi_path: ""          # SX1261 SPI device for spectral scan (empty = disabled)
  spectrum_sweep_interval_seconds: 300 # band-sweep cadence for the spectrum card (0 = on-demand only)
```

The region sets the base frequency, spreading factor, and bandwidth automatically. You only need `region` in most cases. Override `frequency_mhz`, `spreading_factor`, or `bandwidth_khz` individually to tune for non-default presets (MediumFast, ShortFast, etc.) or custom frequency slots.

### Region Defaults and Band Limits

| Region | Default frequency | Allowed band |
|---|---|---|
| `US` | 906.875 MHz | 902.0 - 928.0 MHz |
| `EU_868` | 869.525 MHz | 863.0 - 870.0 MHz |
| `ANZ` | 919.875 MHz | 915.0 - 928.0 MHz |
| `IN` | 865.875 MHz | 865.0 - 867.0 MHz |
| `KR` | 922.875 MHz | 920.0 - 923.0 MHz |
| `SG_923` | 917.875 MHz | 917.0 - 925.0 MHz |

If `frequency_mhz` falls outside the region's band limits, the service will reject it at startup. Omit `frequency_mhz` entirely to tune to the region default.

### Spectral Scan (Noise Floor)

The dashboard's sidebar shows a live noise-floor reading. There are two ways the service can produce that number; which one applies depends on your concentrator hardware.

**Which radio does the scanning:** the SX1261 is a small companion chip **on the concentrator module itself** (e.g. inside the WM1302 on the SenseCap M1), sitting next to the SX1302 on a second SPI chip-select. It only measures RF power — it decodes nothing — which is why spectral scans and band sweeps run while the SX1302 keeps capturing packets. External radios (MeshCore USB companions, the RTL-SDR) are not involved in scanning at all.

**Hardware capability matrix:**

| Carrier board | SX1261 reachable from Pi? | Spectral scan supported? |
|---|---|---|
| Semtech SX1302CXXXGW1 reference kit | yes (own SPI line) | yes |
| SenseCap M1 | yes — `/dev/spidev0.1` (verified in the field) | yes |
| RAK2287 / RAK5146 / some off-the-shelf concentrators | often no (SX1261 wired behind the SX1302's SPI router, not directly to the Pi) | try `/dev/spidev0.1`; fall back if the SX1261 status errors below appear |
| Custom carriers with SX1261 on a dedicated CE line | yes | yes, after configuring `sx1261_spi_path` |

**Default behaviour (works everywhere):** `sx1261_spi_path` is empty, so the service skips the SX1261 init entirely and derives the noise floor from packet metadata — specifically a rolling minimum of `RSSI − SNR` across recently-decoded frames. This is a *loose upper bound* on the true noise floor (it tracks the quietest signal we managed to demodulate), but on a normally-operating link it converges to within a few dB of the real ambient floor and is good enough to spot RF interference, broken antennas, or unusually noisy bands.

**Opting in to true spectral scan:** if you have a board that exposes the SX1261 directly to the Pi (the Semtech reference kit is the common case), add this to `config/local.yaml`:

```yaml
radio:
  sx1261_spi_path: "/dev/spidev0.1"
  spectral_scan_interval_seconds: 60
```

When enabled, every `spectral_scan_interval_seconds` (default 60, minimum 5) the SX1261 samples ambient channel power on the radio's frequency for roughly 50 ms and the service reports the 10th-percentile reading as the noise floor. At 60 s cadence that is ~0.08% of receive time. If you set `spectral_scan_interval_seconds: 0`, scanning is disabled entirely and the packet-derived fallback is used.

**Detecting an unsupported board.** If you set `sx1261_spi_path` on a carrier where the SX1261 isn't directly reachable, `libloragw` will log lines like:

```
ERROR: sx1261_check_status: SX1261 status is not as expected: got:0x00 expected:0x22
ERROR: failed to patch sx1261 radio for LBT/Spectral Scan
```

…and `lgw_start()` may then refuse to bring up the concentrator. If you see that, revert `sx1261_spi_path` to `""`, restart the service, and stay on the packet-derived fallback.

If your `libloragw` build does not expose the spectral scan symbols at all (older HAL revisions), the service logs a single info line at startup and falls back automatically.

**Band spectrum sweep.** With spectral scan enabled, the service also sweeps the whole region band (one scan per 100 kHz step; EU868 = 71 points in a few seconds) every `spectrum_sweep_interval_seconds` (default 300) and draws the result as the **Band Spectrum** card on the RF Environment page — median and peak level per step with the channel positions overlaid. Set it to `0` to disable automatic sweeps; the card's "Sweep now" button (admin) still works. A full sweep costs roughly 4 s of scan time per interval (~1% of receive time at the default cadence).

### Standard Meshtastic Presets

To match a Meshtastic preset, set `spreading_factor` and `bandwidth_khz` together:

| Preset | SF | BW (kHz) |
|---|---|---|
| ShortTurbo | 7 | 500 |
| ShortFast | 7 | 250 |
| ShortSlow | 8 | 250 |
| MediumFast | 9 | 250 |
| MediumSlow | 10 | 250 |
| LongFast (default) | 11 | 250 |
| LongModerate | 11 | 125 |
| LongSlow | 12 | 125 |

**One preset per Meshpoint.** The dashboard preset (LongFast, MediumFast, etc.)
sets a single frequency, bandwidth, and default spreading factor for TX. The
concentrator still demodulates **SF7-SF12 in parallel on that frequency**, so
you can hear nodes using different spreading factors on the same channel plan.
You cannot listen to multiple modem presets or multiple frequencies at once on
one concentrator (multi-preset IF chains are backlog).

### Custom presets (Configuration → Radio)

The dashboard's **Configuration → Radio** card includes a **Custom**
chip alongside the named preset buttons. Selecting Custom reveals
inputs for spreading factor (5-12), bandwidth (125 / 250 / 500 kHz),
and coding rate (4/5, 4/6, 4/7, 4/8). Use it for combinations that
don't appear in the named-preset table above (for example
SF11 / BW125 / CR4/8 for an extra-resilient long-range link, or
SF7 / BW500 / CR4/5 to mirror the deprecated ShortTurbo).

When `current_preset` in the radio configuration is empty (because
the saved SF / BW / CR doesn't match any named preset), the card
opens on Custom automatically and pre-fills the three inputs from
the values in `local.yaml` so you can see exactly what you're on.

Modem changes always require a service restart; the dashboard
prompts you when one is needed. Off-spec combinations (anything
not in the named table) may be silently dropped by neighboring
nodes, so set the same Custom values on the receiving side too.

### Changing Region

```yaml
radio:
  region: "EU_868"
```

To also update your MeshCore companion radio:

```bash
meshpoint meshcore-radio EU
```

Or enter a custom frequency: `meshpoint meshcore-radio custom`

See the [Onboarding Guide](ONBOARDING.md#changing-meshcore-radio-frequency) for full details.

## Capture Sources

```yaml
capture:
  sources:
    - concentrator             # SX1302/SX1303 LoRa concentrator (RAK2287, etc.)
    - meshcore_usb             # optional MeshCore USB companion node
    # - serial                 # optional plain Meshtastic USB node as a capture source
    # - mock                   # optional synthetic packets for development
  meshcore_usb:
    auto_detect: true          # scans /dev/ttyUSB* and /dev/ttyACM*
    serial_port: null          # or set explicitly: "/dev/ttyACM0"
    baud_rate: 115200
```

The setup wizard configures sources automatically. To add or remove a MeshCore companion later, edit `sources` and restart.

**Available source types:**

| Source | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `concentrator` | SX1302/SX1303 LoRa concentrator (RAK2287, RAK7248, SenseCap M1) |
| `meshcore_usb` | MeshCore USB companion node (Heltec V4, T-Beam, RAK4631 with MeshCore firmware) |
| `serial` | Plain Meshtastic node over USB serial. Used when you don't have a concentrator. |
| `mock` | Synthetic packet generator for development. Not for production. |

When running both Meshtastic concentrator capture and a MeshCore USB companion, pin `meshcore_usb.serial_port` explicitly. Auto-detect can grab the wrong device when multiple Espressif boards are attached.

**Multiple Meshtastic USB sticks.** A single stick uses the `serial_port` / `serial_baud` fields above. To capture from more than one at once (e.g. one on 433 MHz, one on 868 MHz), use the `serial` list instead — same shape as `meshcore_usb`'s companion list:

```yaml
capture:
  sources:
    - serial
  serial:
    - serial_port: "/dev/ttyUSB0"
      label: "433"
    - serial_port: "/dev/ttyUSB1"
      label: "868"
```

Each entry's `label` tags its captured packets' `capture_source` as `serial_433` / `serial_868` so the packet feed and drawer can tell them apart, the same way labelled MeshCore companions do. When `capture.serial` is set, the top-level `serial_port` / `serial_baud` fields are ignored.

Configuration → Serial in the dashboard edits this list without hand-editing `local.yaml` — same add/remove/label UI as Configuration → MeshCore's companion editor, minus auto-detect (an empty port already means "let meshtastic-python auto-detect").

---

## Location (GPS) source

```yaml
location:
  source: "static"           # static | gpsd | uart
  gpsd_host: "127.0.0.1"     # gpsd TCP host (only when source=gpsd)
  gpsd_port: 2947            # gpsd TCP port
  update_interval_seconds: 5 # how often the coordinator polls the source
  min_fix_quality: 1         # minimum NMEA fix quality (1=2D, 3=3D)
```

`location.source` selects where the Meshpoint reads **live GPS fixes**
(for the Configuration → GPS skyplot and optional mesh POSITION
broadcasts). The setup wizard always writes static lat/lon/alt under
`device.*` as the **registered Meshradar fleet pin** (see
[Device Identity](#device-identity)); live gpsd does **not** overwrite
those values. Source changes require a service restart; registered
coordinates and mesh position settings hot-reload from the dashboard.

| Source | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `static` (default) | No live GPS hardware. Registered coordinates live in `device.*` only. Skyplot shows the static pin. |
| `gpsd` | Reads live fixes from the system `gpsd` daemon over TCP (`127.0.0.1:2947`). Recommended for any USB GPS receiver (u-blox 7, u-blox 8, VFAN puck, generic CDC ACM sticks). Skyplot and stats update from the live fix. |
| `uart` | Reserved for direct-serial reads from a Pi HAT GPS (e.g. RAK 7248). Currently a placeholder; falls back to static and surfaces an explanatory error in the dashboard. |

### Mesh position broadcasts (LoRa / Meshtastic app map)

When native TX is enabled (`transmit.enabled: true`), the Meshpoint can
send periodic Meshtastic POSITION packets. That is **separate** from
the Meshradar fleet pin in `device.*`.

Configure on **Configuration → GPS → Mesh position broadcasts**, or in
yaml. Set **Position broadcast interval** on the same GPS page (or
`transmit.position.interval_minutes` in yaml). Default is **15 minutes**.
Use **0** to pause POSITION packets without disabling TX.

```yaml
transmit:
  position:
    interval_minutes: 15
    startup_delay_seconds: 180
    coordinate_source: "static"       # static | live
    location_precision: "approximate"  # exact | approximate | none (live only)
```

| Setting | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `coordinate_source` | `static` (default) | Broadcast the registered pin from `device.latitude/longitude`. |
| | `live` | Broadcast the live gpsd/UART fix. Requires `location.source` other than `static`. |
| `location_precision` | `approximate` (default for live) | Round to ~2 decimal places before POSITION TX (about **0.7 mi** / **1.1 km**; the dashboard label follows Settings → Meshpoint distance units). |
| | `exact` | Full precision from the live fix. |
| | `none` | Skip POSITION broadcasts when using live (privacy: no position on mesh). |

When `coordinate_source: static`, coordinates are sent at full wizard
precision regardless of `location_precision`.

### Mesh telemetry broadcasts (LoRa / device health)

When native TX is enabled, the Meshpoint can send periodic Meshtastic
`device_metrics` telemetry (`TELEMETRY_APP`). That is **separate** from
NodeInfo and POSITION.

Configure on **Configuration → Radio → Telemetry broadcast interval**, or in
yaml:

```yaml
transmit:
  telemetry:
    interval_minutes: 30
    startup_delay_seconds: 120
```

Default is **30 minutes**. Use **0** to pause telemetry broadcasts.

### Using gpsd (USB GPS receivers)

`scripts/install.sh` installs `gpsd` and `gpsd-clients`, configures
`/etc/default/gpsd` for **USB hotplug** (`USBAUTO="true"`,
`DEVICES=""`, `GPSD_OPTIONS="-n"`), and enables `gpsd.socket`. As
of v0.7.5 this happens on every fresh install **and** every
upgrade re-run.

To enable live GPS:

1. Plug in a USB GPS receiver. udev rules shipped with `gpsd`
   recognize u-blox VIDs (`0x1546`) and auto-attach the device.
   The MeshCore USB auto-detect path (`UsbPortClassifier`) skips
   any port classified as `gps_known`, so a u-blox stick will
   never be probed as a MeshCore companion.
2. Open the dashboard at **Configuration → GPS**. Set **Registered
   coordinates** (Meshradar fleet pin). Switch **Source** to **gpsd**
   for live skyplot data. Optionally set **Mesh position broadcasts**
   to **Live GPS** with **Approximate** or **Precise** privacy, then
   click **Save**. Changing the GPS source type requires a service
   restart; coordinate and mesh-position edits hot-reload.
3. Watch the **GPS** card. The skyplot animates, satellite dots
   render at their azimuth/elevation, and the fix-mode lamp flips
   from grey (no fix) → amber (2D) → green (3D) as the receiver
   acquires.

For headless / yaml-only setup add the section above to
`local.yaml` and restart the service. Verify with `cgps` (shipped
in `gpsd-clients`) or `gpsmon`.

### Receiver compatibility

| Receiver | Protocol | Tested |
|---|---|---|
| u-blox 7 USB stick | USB CDC ACM, NMEA + UBX | yes (RAK V2 .141) |
| u-blox 8 USB stick | USB CDC ACM, NMEA + UBX | yes |
| VFAN ublox 7 USB puck | USB CDC ACM, NMEA + UBX | yes |
| RAK 7248 onboard u-blox via UART (`/dev/ttyAMA0`) | NMEA over UART | placeholder (`source: uart`, not yet wired) |

Other USB receivers should work as long as `gpsd` recognizes the
device's VID. If `cgps` shows data but the dashboard does not,
check `journalctl -u meshpoint | grep -i gpsd` for connection
errors and confirm `source: gpsd` in `local.yaml`.

### Privacy

Three independent surfaces:

| Surface | Config | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Meshradar cloud** | `device.latitude/longitude` | Always the registered pin. Live GPS never moves the fleet marker. |
| **LoRa mesh (POSITION)** | `transmit.position.coordinate_source` + `location_precision` | Choose registered pin or live GPS; approximate / precise / hidden on live. |
| **MQTT** | `mqtt.location_precision` | Applies to position fields in MQTT publishes only (`exact` / `approximate` / `none`). |

To run a mobile Meshpoint without leaking live coordinates on the mesh,
use **Live GPS** with **Hidden** mesh privacy, or keep mesh source on
**Registered pin**. To keep Meshradar on your home pin while testing
gpsd outdoors, leave registered coordinates at home and use live mesh
POSITION only if you intend to advertise on the LoRa map.

---

## Primary Channel Name

The primary (channel 0) name is used to compute the Meshtastic channel hash on transmitted packets. It must match the primary channel name on your mesh for outgoing messages to be heard.

```yaml
meshtastic:
  primary_channel_name: "LongFast"
```

The default is `LongFast` (Meshtastic's standard public channel). Change it only if your mesh uses a custom primary channel name. You can also edit this from the dashboard: open the **Radio** tab, edit **Channel 0**, and save. The Radio and Messages tabs reflect the same value.

### Quick Deploy (QR export)

**Configuration → Channels → Quick Deploy** exports public channel parameters for field radios:

- QR code and `https://meshtastic.org/e/#…` URL (Meshtastic app compatible)
- Downloadable JSON via `GET /api/config/export`

**Private channel keys are never exported.** The QR uses the standard Meshtastic default PSK only (`AQ==`), matching a public primary channel deployment. Scan with the Meshtastic mobile app (Android in-app scanner; iOS camera).

---

## Private Channel Monitoring

By default, the Meshpoint decrypts traffic on the standard Meshtastic default key (`AQ==`). To also decode packets on your private channels, add the channel keys to `local.yaml`:

```yaml
meshtastic:
  channel_keys:
    MyChannel: "base64encodedPSK=="
    AnotherChannel: "anotherBase64PSK=="
```

**Finding your channel's PSK:** Open the Meshtastic app, go to the channel settings, and copy the pre-shared key (base64 format).

**Channel name must match exactly** what's configured on your Meshtastic node (case-sensitive).

The Meshpoint tries each configured key when decoding a packet. Packets matching any configured key will be fully decoded. Packets on channels with unknown keys will continue to show as ENCRYPTED.

To change the default Meshtastic key (if your primary channel uses a non-default PSK):

```yaml
meshtastic:
  default_key_b64: "yourPrimaryKeyBase64=="
```

### MeshCore Keys

MeshCore uses its own default channel key, configurable separately:

```yaml
meshcore:
  default_key_b64: null              # leave null to use the MeshCore built-in default
  channel_keys: 
    SomeChannelName: "32-BytePSK"      # Meshcore Channel Name with 32-Byte Hex PSK. One channel per line            
```
Any Channels listed in the YAML will show in the UI. Changes made in the UI will be written to the YAML config file and pushed to the USB Companion device. Additionally, all channels will be pushed to the USB Companion device upon Meshpoint startup. Up to 40 user channels (slots 1–40) can be configured; slot 0 is always Public.

### MeshCore Companion Identity (v0.7.5+)

The USB companion's advert name is what neighbors see in their
contact list and on the mesh. As of v0.7.5 the dashboard owns the
rename path:

- **Configuration → MeshCore → Companion name** edits the input,
  ticks "Send advert after save" (default on), and clicks
  **Save Name**. The Meshpoint sends `CMD_SET_ADVERT_NAME` to the
  companion (via `meshcore.commands.set_name`), persists the
  cleaned name to `local.yaml` under `meshcore.companion_name`, and
  optionally fires an advert so neighbors pick up the new name
  immediately.
- The configured name is **re-applied on every USB reconnect**.
  Hot-swapping a freshly-flashed companion, or replacing a
  failed unit, lands the new device on your configured name
  without a manual re-save.

```yaml
meshcore:
  companion_name: "Mesh Lab East"    # optional. When set, re-applied on every USB reconnect.
```

Leaving `companion_name` unset (the default) keeps the v0.7.4
behavior: the Meshpoint trusts whatever name is on the
companion's flash. Set it once from the dashboard; further
reboots / unplug / replug events re-apply automatically.

Validation (shared between the dashboard and the on-connect
re-apply path): the name is stripped of leading/trailing
whitespace, must not be empty, and must fit in **32 UTF-8 bytes**
(conservative cap matching the companion firmware's accepted
range). 4-byte unicode codepoints (some emoji) count toward that
limit.

---

## Smart Relay

> **Status: experimental — native onboard relay added in v0.7.4.** When `transmit.enabled: true` the Meshpoint now relays through its own SX1302 concentrator using identity-preserving re-broadcast (original `source_id` and `packet_id` survive, only `hop_limit` is decremented). No second radio required. **Hardware validation is still in progress** — please report results in Discord or via a Github issue.

### Native onboard relay (preferred)

Set both `transmit` and `relay` to enabled. The same SX1302 that handles outgoing messages re-broadcasts captured packets, sharing duty-cycle accounting so relay traffic can never crowd out user TX:

```yaml
transmit:
  enabled: true
  # ... see Transmit (Native Messaging) below for the full block

relay:
  enabled: true
  max_relay_per_minute: 20
  burst_size: 5
  min_relay_rssi: -110.0
  max_relay_rssi: -50.0
  # serial_port intentionally omitted — native path is used
```

Encrypted packets (no key match locally) and MeshCore packets are intentionally skipped on the native path to avoid emitting garbage on the air.

### Legacy USB-companion relay

The original v0.7.0–v0.7.3 path is preserved for setups that already have a second Meshtastic radio attached. Only used when `transmit.enabled: false` and `relay.serial_port` is set:

```yaml
relay:
  enabled: true
  serial_port: "/dev/ttyACM1"  # relay radio serial port
  serial_baud: 115200
  max_relay_per_minute: 20     # token-bucket rate limit
  burst_size: 5                # max burst before throttle
  min_relay_rssi: -110.0       # ignore weak packets
  max_relay_rssi: -50.0        # ignore local packets (too strong)
```

The relay path is independent from RX: transmission never blocks packet reception. Packets are deduplicated by ID, rate-limited, and filtered by signal strength before relay.

---

## Transmit (Native Messaging)

Enable the Meshpoint to send messages directly through the onboard SX1302 concentrator (Meshtastic) and the MeshCore USB companion (MeshCore). This powers the Messages tab on the local dashboard.

```yaml
transmit:
  enabled: false               # opt-in
  node_id: null                # auto-generated 4-byte Meshtastic node ID
  tx_power_dbm: 14             # conservative default (dBm)
  # max_duty_cycle_percent omitted: auto-derives from radio.region
  long_name: "Meshpoint"
  short_name: "MPNT"
  hop_limit: 3
```

**`enabled`**: must be `true` to send from the Messages tab. Disabled by default.

**`node_id`**: leave as `null` to auto-generate. Once set, do not change it: your node identity is what other nodes see and cache in their contact lists.

**`tx_power_dbm`**: 14 dBm is conservative and compliant in most regions. Raise carefully; check your regional ISM band limits before increasing.

**`max_duty_cycle_percent`**: airtime limit as a percent of wall clock. Omit (or set to `null`) to auto-derive from `radio.region`: 10% in US/ANZ/KR/SG_923, 1% in EU_868/IN. Set explicitly in `local.yaml` to override (e.g. `25.0`). See `RADIO-CONFIG-EXPLAINED.md` for the full table and rationale.

**`long_name` / `short_name`**: shown to other nodes (long name in node lists, short name on compact displays). Match your naming convention.

**`hop_limit`**: initial hop count on outgoing Meshtastic messages. 3 is typical; higher values mean more relays and more airtime.

MeshCore transmission uses the USB companion node: configure its serial port under `capture.meshcore_usb` (see Capture Sources above). The companion handles encryption and RF timing; the Meshpoint sends serial commands.

---

## Upstream (Cloud)

```yaml
upstream:
  enabled: true
  url: "wss://api.meshradar.io"
  reconnect_interval_seconds: 10
  buffer_max_size: 5000        # local buffer during disconnects
  auth_token: null             # set by setup wizard
```

When enabled, the Meshpoint connects to [Meshradar](https://meshradar.io) via WebSocket and relays captured packets for aggregated mesh intelligence. The connection auto-reconnects with backoff and buffers packets locally during outages.

### Running Offline

To run the Meshpoint without sending anything to the cloud, set:

```yaml
upstream:
  enabled: false
```

When `enabled: false` the Meshpoint never opens an upstream connection and never transmits any packet, heartbeat, or telemetry to meshradar.io. All capture, decoding, dashboard, MQTT, and storage features still work.

> **Note:** the service still requires a valid `auth_token` to be present in your config at startup. Run the setup wizard once and paste the API key you received from Meshradar, then flip `upstream.enabled: false` and operate fully offline. A standalone "no API key required" mode is on the backlog.

---

## Storage

```yaml
storage:
  database_path: "data/concentrator.db"
  max_packets_retained: 100000
  cleanup_interval_seconds: 3600
```

Packets are stored in a local SQLite database. Old packets are pruned automatically based on `max_packets_retained`.

### Prometheus metrics (`/metrics`)

Optional Prometheus text scrape endpoint for LAN monitoring. **Off by default** — enabling does not change packet capture, relay, or dashboard behaviour.

```yaml
metrics:
  enabled: false
  require_auth: true    # when false, /metrics is open on the LAN (use firewall rules)
```

When `metrics.enabled: true`, Prometheus (or any scraper) can poll:

```text
http://<pi-ip>:8080/metrics
```

Exposed series include packet counts, node totals, RSSI/SNR averages, noise floor, relay stats, per-channel duty estimates (ToA), SX1302 CRC counters, and process uptime. Labels use protocol/channel/reason only — never PSKs, tokens, or node secrets.

**Example `prometheus.yml` scrape job (auth disabled):**

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: meshpoint
    scrape_interval: 30s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["192.168.1.50:8080"]
    metrics_path: /metrics
```

When `require_auth: true`, configure your scraper to send the dashboard session cookie or Bearer JWT (same as other protected API routes).

---

## Dashboard

```yaml
dashboard:
  host: "0.0.0.0"             # listen on all interfaces
  port: 8080
  static_dir: "frontend"
```

Access at `http://<pi-ip>:8080`. Bind to `127.0.0.1` to restrict to local access only.

Changes take effect on service restart. If the configured address can't be used (config typo, port already taken, privileged port), the server logs the problem and falls back to `0.0.0.0:8080` so the dashboard stays reachable.

### RF Environment tab

Open **RF Environment** in the sidebar for a full-page noise-floor sparkline, calibration state, and the latest SX1302 spectral-scan histogram. Data comes from `GET /api/rf/status` (same sources as the sidebar telemetry rail).

- **Live scan** — hardware spectral scan on the tuned channel (`radio.spectral_scan_interval_seconds` > 0 and SX1261/HAL support present)
- **Packet fallback** — rolling minimum of `RSSI − SNR` when scan is disabled or unavailable
- Set `radio.spectral_scan_interval_seconds: 0` in **Configuration → Advanced** to disable hardware scan; the tab shows a clear message and uses packet fallback only

---

## Fan Control (SenseCap M1)

```yaml
fan:
  enabled: false        # opt-in -- this hardware doesn't exist on RAK V2/Chameleon/DIY
  gpio_pin: 13           # confirmed via scripts/test_gpio_hardware.py fan-scan
  min_temp_c: 45.0        # ramp starts here
  max_temp_c: 65.0        # 100% duty at/above this
  min_duty: 0.35          # floor once ramping -- most small fans stall below this
  hysteresis_c: 5.0       # fan stays on until temp drops this far below min_temp_c
  poll_interval_s: 10.0
```

Temperature-driven PWM control for the SenseCap M1's onboard fan, reading CPU temperature from the Pi's thermal zone. GPIO 13 is a hardware-PWM-capable pin on the Pi 4 (BCM2711 PWM1), confirmed live as this board's fan pin with `scripts/test_gpio_hardware.py`; the onboard LED (GPIO 22) and user button (GPIO 27) were confirmed the same way.

Disabled by default: this fan/GPIO wiring is specific to the SenseCap M1 carrier board, not other supported hardware. Duty ramps linearly between `min_temp_c` and `max_temp_c`; below `min_temp_c - hysteresis_c` the fan turns fully off. If either dependency below is missing, a clear error is logged at startup and the fan is simply not driven rather than the app failing to start.

Requires `gpiozero` and `lgpio` in the Meshpoint **venv** specifically (both in `requirements.txt`, but a venv doesn't share Raspberry Pi OS's system-wide packages, so an existing install needs these added by hand — see `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for the full command chain, since `lgpio` builds a C extension and needs `python3-dev`/`swig`/`liblgpio-dev` first). Without `lgpio` (or `RPi.GPIO`/`pigpio`), gpiozero falls back to a pure-Python pin factory that refuses PWM on this board's repurposed GPIO13 (`PinPWMUnsupported`), even though it's a real PWM-capable pin on the Pi 4 SoC.

---

## Status LED (SenseCap M1)

```yaml
led:
  enabled: false        # opt-in -- same rationale as fan:
  gpio_pin: 22           # confirmed via scripts/test_gpio_hardware.py led
  activity_blink: true   # brief off-dip per captured packet
```

Drives the M1's onboard case LED as a glanceable status light with four states: **steady on** = service running and every configured capture source healthy (concentrator, MeshCore companions, Meshtastic USB sticks); **brief off-flicker** = a packet was just captured (set `activity_blink: false` for a calm steady light); **1 Hz blink** = one or more configured capture sources are down; **dark** = the service isn't running (when the process dies the kernel releases the GPIO line, so no watchdog is needed).

Plain on/off GPIO — no PWM involved, so unlike the fan it works even without `lgpio` (gpiozero's fallback pin factory handles simple output pins fine). Same venv note as the fan applies for `gpiozero` itself.

---

## Device Identity

```yaml
device:
  device_name: "My Meshpoint"
  latitude: 40.7128
  longitude: -74.0060
  altitude: 25
```

Set during the setup wizard. The coordinates are used for map placement on the local dashboard and the Meshradar cloud dashboard, and as the reference point for "farthest direct node" distance.

### Updating Location

Three options:

1. **Configuration → GPS** in the dashboard (recommended). Edit lat/lon/alt for `source: static`, or switch to `source: gpsd` to consume live fixes from a USB GPS receiver. See [Location (GPS) source](#location-gps-source) above.

2. Edit `local.yaml` directly (fastest for headless tweaks):

   ```bash
   sudo nano /opt/meshpoint/config/local.yaml
   # change device.latitude / device.longitude / device.altitude
   sudo systemctl restart meshpoint
   ```

3. Re-run the setup wizard and press Enter through steps you want to keep:

   ```bash
   sudo /opt/meshpoint/venv/bin/python -m src.cli setup
   sudo systemctl restart meshpoint
   ```

**Tip**: in Google Maps, right-click any location and click the coordinates at the top of the menu to copy them in decimal format (e.g. `40.7128, -74.0060`).

## MQTT Feed

Publish captured packets to community MQTT brokers (meshmap.net, NHmesh.live, etc.) and Home Assistant. The Meshpoint acts as a dual-protocol MQTT gateway: both Meshtastic and MeshCore traffic can be published from a single device.

### Privacy: Two-Gate Safety Model

MQTT publishing uses two independent safety gates to prevent accidental exposure of private data:

**Gate 1: Global kill switch.** MQTT is off by default. You must explicitly set `mqtt.enabled: true` to activate publishing. Nothing is ever sent to any MQTT broker unless you opt in.

**Gate 2: Channel allowlist.** Only packets from channels listed in `publish_channels` are published. The default list contains only `LongFast` (the standard Meshtastic public channel). Private channels, custom PSK channels, and encrypted packets are never published unless you deliberately add that channel name to the list.

Both gates must pass for any packet to leave the device via MQTT. Encrypted packets (those the Meshpoint could not decrypt) are always blocked regardless of channel configuration.

This two-gate approach is informed by active community discussion around MQTT privacy, including the need for explicit opt-in controls ([meshtastic/firmware#5507](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/issues/5507)), concerns about private channel data leaking via MQTT gateways ([meshtastic/firmware#5404](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/issues/5404)), and the broader push for user-controlled MQTT publishing ([meshtastic/firmware#3549](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/issues/3549)).

### Basic Setup

```yaml
mqtt:
  enabled: true
  broker: "mqtt.meshtastic.org"
  port: 1883
  username: "meshdev"
  password: "large4cats"
  region: "US"
  publish_channels:
    - "LongFast"
```

This publishes standard Meshtastic and MeshCore traffic to the community broker. Your Meshpoint appears on community maps (meshmap.net, Liam Cottle, NHmesh) with a unique gateway ID that integrates natively with the Meshtastic ecosystem.

### Configuration Options

```yaml
mqtt:
  enabled: false                 # Gate 1: must be true to publish
  broker: "mqtt.meshtastic.org"  # broker hostname
  port: 1883                     # broker port
  username: "meshdev"            # broker credentials
  password: "large4cats"
  topic_root: "msh"             # MQTT topic prefix
  region: "US"                   # used in topic path
  publish_channels:              # Gate 2: only these channels are published
    - "LongFast"
  publish_json: false            # also publish JSON on /json/ topic
  location_precision: "exact"    # exact | approximate | none
  homeassistant_discovery: false # publish HA auto-discovery configs
```

### Transport TLS (not yet available)

Configuration → MQTT does **not** expose TLS/mqtts settings yet. The publisher
uses plain TCP; port **8883** alone does not enable encryption.

**Planned:** ship broker TLS (`tls_enabled`, optional CA file) in the same
update as **Meshtastic PKI** (see `ROADMAP.md` in the private repo). Until
then:

- Public Meshtastic MQTT: `mqtt.meshtastic.org` on port **1883** (default).
- Private TLS brokers: wait for that release, or terminate TLS on a local
  reverse proxy in front of a plain MQTT listener.

This is separate from **packet privacy**: undecrypted LoRa packets are never
published to MQTT regardless of transport settings.

### Location Precision

Control how much location detail leaves the device via MQTT:

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `exact` | Full GPS coordinates (default) |
| `approximate` | Rounded to ~2 decimal places (about 0.7 mi / 1.1 km; Configuration → MQTT and GPS labels follow Settings → Meshpoint distance units) |
| `none` | Location stripped entirely from MQTT messages |

Full-precision location data is always available on the [Meshradar](https://meshradar.io) dashboard regardless of this setting.

### Home Assistant Integration

Enable JSON publishing and HA auto-discovery to automatically create sensors in Home Assistant for battery level, temperature, and GPS position of mesh nodes:

```yaml
mqtt:
  enabled: true
  publish_json: true
  homeassistant_discovery: true
```

HA sensors appear as `sensor.meshpoint_<node_id>_battery`, `sensor.meshpoint_<node_id>_temperature`, and `device_tracker.meshpoint_<node_id>`.

### Publishing Private Channels

If you want to publish traffic from a private channel (for example, to feed it into your own HA instance on a local broker), add the channel name to `publish_channels` and point the broker to your local MQTT server:

```yaml
mqtt:
  enabled: true
  broker: "192.168.1.100"        # your local broker
  username: ""
  password: ""
  publish_channels:
    - "LongFast"
    - "MyPrivateChannel"         # explicitly opted in
```

Never add private channel names when publishing to a public broker.
