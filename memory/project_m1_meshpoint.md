# Project M1 — Sensecap M1 Mega-Sniffer (5 networks)

## What we built

A 5-network passive sniffer on the Sensecap M1 (SX1302 concentrator).
It listens simultaneously to LoRaWAN, Meshtastic, and MeshCore on 433 and 868 MHz.
Meshtastic packets are relayed. LoRaWAN and MeshCore are listen-only.
The codebase lives in `meshpoint_lorawan/`.

## Hardware

| Device | Protocol | Band | Interface |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sensecap M1 (SX1302) | LoRaWAN + Meshtastic | 868 MHz | onboard |
| Heltec V3 868 MHz (~€21) | MeshCore | 868 MHz | USB `/dev/ttyACM0` |
| Heltec V3 433 MHz (~€22.75) | MeshCore | 433 MHz | USB `/dev/ttyACM1` |
| Heltec V3 433 MHz (owned) | Meshtastic | 433 MHz | USB `/dev/ttyUSB0` |
| 868 MHz tags | MeshCore | 868 MHz | over-air via Heltec 868 |
| P1 SolarNode | MeshCore | 868 MHz | over-air via Heltec 868 |

### Hardware notes
- Heltec V3: flash with `companion_radio_usb` MeshCore firmware from flasher.meshcore.io
- Heltec V4 USB gotcha: MeshCore enumerates as `303a:0002`, Meshtastic as `303a:1001` — opposite of expected
- Heltec V3 for Meshtastic 433: flash with Meshtastic EU_433 firmware, connect via `serial` source (NOT `meshcore_usb`)

## CRITICAL: MeshCore USB vs Meshtastic serial — two different protocols

**`meshcore_usb` source** — for Heltec/T-Beam running MeshCore firmware:
- Speaks MeshCore serial event format (proprietary)
- Use for: Heltec V3, T-Beam, Wireless Tracker with MeshCore `companion_radio_usb` firmware
- Config key: `capture.meshcore_usb` (list, up to 4)

**`serial` source** — for Heltec V3/any device running Meshtastic firmware:
- Speaks Meshtastic serial protocol (protobuf)
- Use for: Heltec V3, any Meshtastic node connected via USB
- Config key: `capture.serial_port` + `capture.serial_baud`

You CANNOT use `meshcore_usb` for a Meshtastic device — it will read garbage.
You CANNOT use `serial` for a MeshCore device — it will read garbage.

## Key technical solutions

### Dual sync word on SX1302

SX1302 has one global syncword register set but the service channel (ch8) has
its own pair of registers that can be overridden independently.

**Solution:**
1. Set `lorawan_public = True` → `lgw_start()` programs ch0–ch7 to LoRaWAN 0x34 (PEAK1=6, PEAK2=8).
2. After `lgw_start()`, call `lgw_reg_w()` on registers 932/933 only (service channel) to set Meshtastic 0x2B (PEAK1=4, PEAK2=22).

**Register IDs:**
- `SX1302_REG_RX_TOP_LORA_SERVICE_FSK_FRAME_SYNCH0_PEAK1_POS = 932`
- `SX1302_REG_RX_TOP_LORA_SERVICE_FSK_FRAME_SYNCH0_PEAK2_POS = 933`

**Formula:** `PEAK = 2 × nibble`
- 0x34 → PEAK1=6, PEAK2=8
- 0x2B → PEAK1=4, PEAK2=22

**Files:** `src/hal/sx1302_signatures.py`, `src/hal/sx1302_wrapper.py`

### EU868 channel plan

RF0 = 868.3 MHz, RF1 = 869.525 MHz

**Correction (superseded the original plan below the line):** ch0-ch7 (multi-SF)
share ONE board-wide syncword register set — `lorawan_public=True` locks all of
them to 0x34 at `lgw_start()`, with no per-channel override. Only ch8 (service
channel) can be set independently via direct register writes. That means a
multi-SF channel can **never** decode Meshtastic (0x2B) regardless of which
frequency it's tuned to — the original plan's ch3/ch4 "Meshtastic 0x2B" row
below was never actually true; those channels only ever listened with 0x34 and
caught nothing, since no LoRaWAN traffic exists at 869.4625/869.5875 MHz.

Fixed plan: RF0 uses its full ±400 kHz IF window (867.9-868.7 MHz) for 5 real
LoRaWAN channels instead of 3, and the dead RF1 multi-SF slots are disabled
instead of pointed at frequencies they could never usefully receive.

| ch | Freq (Hz) | BW | SF | Syncword | Protocol |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 867_900_000 | 125k | 7-12 | 0x34 | LoRaWAN |
| 1 | 868_100_000 | 125k | 7-12 | 0x34 | LoRaWAN |
| 2 | 868_300_000 | 125k | 7-12 | 0x34 | LoRaWAN |
| 3 | 868_500_000 | 125k | 7-12 | 0x34 | LoRaWAN |
| 4 | 868_700_000 | 125k | 7-12 | 0x34 | LoRaWAN (RF0 IF edge, +400 kHz — unverified in field) |
| 5-7 | — | — | — | — | disabled |
| 8 | 869_525_000 | 250k | SF11 | 0x2B | Meshtastic (service ch, only real Meshtastic path) |

`concentrator_config.py` → `eu868_lorawan()` static method, used by `for_region("EU_868")`.

### Protocol routing by frequency

`concentrator_source.py`:
```python
_MESHTASTIC_EU868_FREQS_HZ = frozenset({869_525_000})
protocol_hint = Protocol.MESHTASTIC if pkt.frequency_hz in _MESHTASTIC_EU868_FREQS_HZ else Protocol.LORAWAN
```

### ch8 (service channel) always on RF1 — bug that was fixed

`_configure_if_channels()` hardcoded `rf_chain = 0` for the single-SF channel.
With RF0=868.3 MHz and ch8=869.525 MHz, ch8 physically belongs to RF1.

Fix in `sx1302_wrapper.py`:
```python
conf.rf_chain = 0 if ch.frequency_hz <= radio_0_freq + 500_000 else 1
center = radio_0_freq if conf.rf_chain == 0 else plan.radio_1_freq_hz
```

## LoRaWAN support

### Model types (`src/models/packet.py`)
- `Protocol.LORAWAN`
- `PacketType.LORAWAN_JOIN`, `LORAWAN_DATA`, `LORAWAN_REJOIN`

### LoRaWAN decoder (`src/decode/lorawan_decoder.py`)

| MType | Frame | Fields extracted |
|---|---|---|
| 000 | Join-Request | AppEUI (LSB), DevEUI (LSB), DevNonce, MIC |
| 010/100 | Data Up | DevAddr, FCnt, FPort, FRMPayload (hex, encrypted), MIC |
| 110 | Rejoin | Type 0/1/2 with appropriate EUI/ID fields |

- `source_id` = DevEUI (join) or DevAddr hex (data)
- Payload NOT decrypted (no AppSKey/NwkSKey)

### Relay safety (double protection)
1. `hop_limit = 0` default on all LoRaWAN packets
2. `PacketType.LORAWAN_*` not in `RELAY_WORTHY_TYPES`

LoRaWAN is **never** relayed.

### LoRaWAN isolation from node system (`src/coordinator.py`)
- `_update_node()` early-returns for `Protocol.LORAWAN` — DevAddrs never appear as mesh nodes
- `_store_telemetry()` early-returns for `Protocol.LORAWAN`

### Routing order in PacketRouter
LORAWAN checked **first** before MESHTASTIC to avoid false positives.

---

## Multi USB companion support (MeshCore)

### Config (`src/config.py`)
- `MeshcoreUsbConfig` has `label: str = ""` field
- `CaptureConfig.meshcore_usb` is `list[MeshcoreUsbConfig]` (was single object)
- `_coerce_meshcore_usb()` accepts old dict format OR new list-of-dicts — backward compat
- Source name: `meshcore_usb_{label}` when label set (e.g. `meshcore_usb_868`)

### API endpoints
- `PUT /api/config/capture/meshcore-usb` — edits companion[0] only (backward compat)
- `PUT /api/config/capture/meshcore-companions` — replaces full list atomically (max 4)

### Bug fixed in server.py
`_add_meshcore_usb_source()` and the auto-detect check in `_build_pipeline()` were
still treating `meshcore_usb` as a single object. Fixed to loop over the list.

---

## LoRaWAN UI (dashboard page)

### Backend (`src/api/routes/lorawan_routes.py`)
- `GET /api/lorawan/devices` — one row per DevEUI/DevAddr: frame_count, first_seen, last_seen, RSSI, SNR, freq, SF
- `GET /api/lorawan/packets` — recent packets log (limit param, max 1000)
- `GET /api/lorawan/stats` — totals: total_packets, unique_devices, by_type counts

### Frontend
- `frontend/js/lorawan_panel.js` — `LoRaWANPanel` class, show/hide with auto-refresh (15s)
- `frontend/css/lorawan.css` — panel styles, type badges (Join=green, Data=cyan, Rejoin=amber)
- `index.html` — sidebar nav item + `data-section="lorawan"` section
- `app.js` — `_bootLoRaWANPanel(router)`, `'lorawan'` added to `allowedRoutes`

## MeshCore signal metadata: freq / SF / hops (2026-07-05)

MeshCore packets come from a USB companion radio, not the onboard SX1302, so
their per-packet metadata is different from Meshtastic/LoRaWAN captures.

### Frequency / SF — static per companion, read from handshake
The `meshcore` library's event stream only carries RSSI/SNR per packet, NOT
freq/SF (those are static radio config, not per-packet telemetry). They live on
`self._meshcore.self_info` (keys `radio_freq` / `radio_bw` / `radio_sf`),
populated once at connect-time handshake — the same object the Config > MeshCore
page reads via `get_radio_info()`.

- **Fix:** `_wrap_event()` in `src/capture/meshcore_usb_source.py` now reads
  `self._meshcore.self_info` and passes it to `_extract_signal(payload, radio_info)`,
  which stamps freq/BW/SF instead of the old hardcoded `0.0`/`0`. Downstream
  `_rf_signal_from_payload()` in `src/decode/meshcore_event_adapter.py` was also
  re-zeroing these — fixed to preserve the fallback SignalMetrics.
- **Multi-companion:** value is per-instance (each companion's own `self_info`),
  so an 868 vs 433 stick each report their real channel independently.

### Hops — from path_len, was never read
CONTACT_MSG_RECV / CHANNEL_MSG_RECV events carry `path_len` = real hop count
(verified in the `meshcore` PyPI package `reader.py`; cross-checked against
firmware `MeshCore/src/Packet.h`). ADVERTISEMENT/nodeinfo events do NOT carry
path info — those stay blank by design.

- **Fix:** `_hop_start_from_payload()` in `meshcore_event_adapter.py` converts
  `path_len` → `hop_start` (255 is the firmware's "direct message" sentinel → 0
  hops, not a literal 255). `_build_contact_message` / `_build_channel_message`
  now set it. hop_limit stays 0 so the existing `hop_count` property returns
  path_len unchanged.

### capture_source now carries the companion label
`_wrap_event()` stamps `capture_source=self.name` (was hardcoded
`"meshcore_usb"`), so labelled companions store `meshcore_usb_868` /
`meshcore_usb_433` etc. Only matcher is the coordinator's
`startswith("meshcore_usb")`, which all variants satisfy. (The Meshtastic
`serial` source is still single-instance / unlabelled — would need a list-field
config change to support `meshtastic_usb_*`.)

## Imported-contacts / neighbours workflow (`import_contacts.py` in repo ROOT)

There are TWO import scripts: `meshpoint_lorawan/import_contacts.py` (older,
nodes-only) and the ROOT `import_contacts.py` (newer, imports contacts AND
neighbours, and inserts synthetic `neighbour_advert` packet rows with
`packet_id` prefix `nb:<node>:<ts>` to surface neighbour SNR in panels).

- **Synthetic rows now stamp freq/SF/BW** (defaults 869.618 / SF8 / 62.5 kHz,
  overridable via `--freq/--sf/--bw`) so they display like real captures and
  each re-import doesn't re-blank them. (Still show blank RSSI/FREQ/SF in the
  packet feed — they only carry SNR; cosmetic, not yet addressed.)
- **Canonical refresh order (`importcontacts.sh`): import → repair → backfill.**
  1. `sudo python3 import_contacts.py --freq 869.618 --sf 8 --bw 62.5`
  2. `sudo python3 meshpoint_lorawan/scripts/repair_neighbour_timestamps.py --apply`
  3. `sudo python3 meshpoint_lorawan/scripts/backfill_meshcore_signal.py --apply`

### Timestamp saga (root causes + fixes, 2026-07-05)
The `nb:` synthetic rows and each node's `nodes.last_heard` were landing at
wrong times in BOTH directions. Three distinct causes, all now fixed in the
ROOT `import_contacts.py`:

1. **Past (2024) rows → "777 days since first packet".** Some neighbours report
   a stale/absent `last_advert`; old rows sorted `MIN(timestamp)` to 2024.
2. **Future rows → node pinned to top as "Now".** ROOT CAUSE: the
   `neighbours.json` **generator machine writes Amsterdam local time (CEST,
   UTC+2) in its `generated` field with no timezone marker**. Parsed as UTC it
   is ~2h ahead, so `generated - secs_ago` (and the nodes' own fast RTCs via
   `last_advert`) produced future timestamps.
   FIX: compute `last_heard = now - secs_ago`, anchoring `secs_ago` (a reliable
   RELATIVE measure) to **our own trusted clock**, never the file's skewed
   `generated` field or the node's `last_advert`. Immune to both skews. Fall
   back to `last_advert` only when `secs_ago` is absent; `_clamp_future()` is a
   final safety net.
3. **Sticky poison.** `nodes.last_heard` sorts the node list and the upsert
   only ever RAISED it, so a once-poisoned high value (future / clamp-to-now)
   could never be corrected down.
   FIX: neighbour upsert is now AUTHORITATIVE, floored at real packets:
   `last_heard = MAX(excluded.last_heard, latest real captured packet)`.
   Corrects poisoned highs down to the true time, never regresses a genuine
   live capture. Verified both directions on scratch DBs.

### Repair script (`scripts/repair_neighbour_timestamps.py`) — safety net
Catches `nb:%` rows that are pre-`--cutoff` (default 2026-01-01) OR in the
future (> now + 2min), AND resets any future `nodes.last_heard`. Per node picks
best real date: (1) latest real captured packet, else (2) `nodes.last_heard`
if sane (>= cutoff, not future), else (3) clamp to earliest real packet.
Nothing deleted; idempotent. With the import fixes above it usually finds
nothing to do. Backfill script targets all `protocol='meshcore'` rows with
`frequency_mhz` 0/NULL.

### Files changed (2026-07-05)
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/capture/meshcore_usb_source.py` | freq/SF from `self_info`; `capture_source=self.name`; removed `_EMPTY_SIGNAL` |
| `src/decode/meshcore_event_adapter.py` | preserve freq/SF in `_rf_signal_from_payload`; `_hop_start_from_payload` from `path_len` |
| `import_contacts.py` (root) | neighbour rows stamp freq/SF/BW (`--freq/--sf/--bw`); `last_heard = now - secs_ago` (skew-immune); `_clamp_future()`; AUTHORITATIVE `MAX(excluded, real-packet floor)` upsert |
| `scripts/repair_neighbour_timestamps.py` | **NEW** — fix past AND future `nb:` timestamps + future `nodes.last_heard` |
| `scripts/backfill_meshcore_signal.py` | **NEW** — backfill freq/SF on old meshcore rows |

### RTL-SDR web listener (REBUILT + FULLY WIRED locally — 2026-07-05 evening)
Audio-only browser SDR (rtl_fm -> ffmpeg MP3 -> fan-out), tune-anywhere, no
waterfall, uses the RTL-SDR (separate from SX1302). The first attempt's files
were LOST in the revert (never committed — git log -S confirmed); rebuilt from
scratch and this time the wiring is IN:

- `src/audio/rtl_listener.py` — RtlListener: shell pipeline
  `rtl_fm | ffmpeg -f mp3` in own process group (killpg stop), restart-based
  tuning, per-client asyncio.Queue fan-out (drop-oldest on slow clients),
  10-min idle auto-stop, modes nfm/am/usb/lsb/wfm (wfm = rtl_fm `wbfm` alias,
  32 kHz; others 16 kHz), 64 kbps MP3.
- `src/api/routes/listener_routes.py` — /api/listener: GET status, POST tune,
  POST stop, GET stream (StreamingResponse audio/mpeg). Registered with
  `dependencies=protected`; the HttpOnly session cookie authenticates the
  <audio> element, no token plumbing needed.
- `server.py` — import, `_rtl_listener` global created in lifespan after
  `_init_routes`, stopped first in shutdown, router registered after lorawan.
- `frontend/js/listener_panel.js` + `frontend/css/listener.css` (lsn-*
  classes) — freq/mode/squelch/gain controls, preset buttons (FM 100.0,
  PMR446, 2m 145.5, 433.5, marine ch16, airband AM), <audio> with stream URL
  cache-busted per tune.
- `index.html` (css link + nav "Listener" + section + script tag),
  `app.js` (`listener` in allowedRoutes, `_bootListenerPanel`).

Status: py_compile + node --check pass; NOT yet deployed — the user pushes to
the Pi themselves (never SSH the Pi unprompted). Pi prerequisites verified
earlier: rtl_fm/rtl_test in /usr/local/bin, ffmpeg 7.1.5 with libmp3lame,
dvb_usb_rtl28xxu blacklisted, dongle now permanently on a USB3 port.
OpenWebRX+ remains ruled out (needs Docker — python3-csdr wants python <3.12
on Trixie).

#### RTL-SDR vs MeshCore "name conflict" — SOLVED (2026-07-05 evening)
The reason the listener was parked ("RTL-SDR takes the same name as MeshCore
and kicks it out") turned out to be FALSE as stated but real in effect:
- RTL-SDR (0bda:2838, RTL2838UHIDIR, R820T tuner) creates NO tty at all —
  it can never steal `/dev/ttyUSB0` from the MeshCore CP2102.
- ROOT CAUSE = POWER: hot-plug inrush browns out the M1's internal 4-port
  VIA hub. First incident: CP2102 disconnected/re-enumerated → app's open
  MeshCore serial handle died ("kicked out"). Second test (2026-07-05):
  whole Pi hard-rebooted (uptime 1 min after plug-in).
- RULE: never hot-plug the RTL-SDR; leave it permanently connected (or use a
  powered hub). Once enumerated, `rtl_test` runs clean (0 lost samples @
  2.048 MS/s) while MeshCore capture keeps working — verified live.
- Box is listener-ready: `dvb_usb_rtl28xxu` already blacklisted in
  /etc/modprobe.d, `rtl_fm`/`rtl_test` in /usr/local/bin. `[R82XX] PLL not
  locked!` at startup is harmless init noise.
- Everything self-heals after a reboot: meshpoint.service auto-starts and the
  MeshCore source reconnects on its own.

#### Live device config drift (2026-07-05)
The M1 (`pi@192.168.2.189`, service config at `/opt/meshpoint/config/local.yaml`)
currently runs only TWO sources: `concentrator` + ONE `meshcore_usb` companion
at `/dev/ttyUSB0` (CP2102, label "", auto_detect false). The 5-network
local.yaml above (2× ACM MeshCore + Meshtastic serial) is NOT what is deployed
right now. Repo copy `meshpoint_lorawan/config/local.yaml` is also stale vs
the live one. Consider `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2102_...-if00-port0`
instead of ttyUSB0 for robustness if more USB devices get added.

#### Listener enhancements (2026-07-05 evening → live, working)
Built on the base above; all verified working in the browser (FM audio + meter).

**Presets — data-driven, grouped.** `ListenerPanel.PRESET_GROUPS` (static getter)
renders labelled sections via `_presetsHtml()`; delegated click handler picks up
any `button[data-freq]`. Full precision preserved (no toFixed rounding — PMR
needs 5 decimals). Sections:
- Amsterdam FM Radio (WFM): R1 98.6, R2 92.3, 3FM 96.5, Klassiek 94.3, FunX 96.1,
  Qmusic 100.4, 538 102.4, R10 91.6, Sky 101.5, Joe 103.8, Veronica 95.3,
  100%NL 89.6, SLAM! 98.0, BNR 101.8. (Joe/100%NL/SLAM are nationwide freqs.)
- PMR446 (NFM): all 16 channels 446.00625–446.19375.
- Marine VHF marifoon (NFM): Ch10 156.5, Ch16 156.8, Ch31 ship 156.55 / coast
  161.15, Ch67 156.375, Ch77 156.875.
- Marine UHF on-board (NFM): 10 ch, 457.525–457.575 / 467.525–467.575 (Ch2/4 social).
- Schiphol airband (AM): Tower/Approach+Radar/Ground+Delivery/ATIS+Emergency.
  IMPORTANT: uses the ACTUAL 8.33 kHz carrier freqs (e.g. 118.100), NOT the
  channel-label numbers (118.105).
- Ham & Utility (NFM): 2m 145.5, 70cm 433.5.

**Overmodulation / level control.** rtl_fm PCM runs hot and clips. ffmpeg `-af`
now `volume={self.volume},alimiter=limit=0.9,ebur128`. A live **Level slider**
sets the PRE-ENCODER `volume` (clip fix must be before the MP3 encoder — browser
volume can't undo baked-in clipping); range 0.05–1.5. `DEFAULT_VOLUME = 0.45`
(bake-in default; `MIN/MAX_VOLUME` clamp). Slider applies on release
(`change`, not `input`) only while playing. **Resets to 0.45 on every preset
switch** (`_resetLevel()` — user found a carried-over 0.85 too hot).

**Clean channel switching = stop → tune → listen.** `_tune()` calls
`_stopAudio()` first (drops the old browser stream) before POSTing tune; backend
`tune()` already stop+starts the pipeline; then `_startAudio()` reconnects with a
cache-busted URL. Not gapless (~1-2s) — inherent to one dongle retuning.

**Device-busy race on fast switches — FIXED.** Symptom: "idle — Failed to open
rtlsdr device #0". Cause: `_stop_locked` killpg's the group but `proc.wait()`
reaps the *shell*, which exits before rtl_fm finishes releasing libusb → new
rtl_fm hits a still-busy device. Fix in `tune()`: `_DEVICE_SETTLE_SECS=0.4`
sleep between stop and start when `was_running`, plus `_start_locked_retrying()`
(start → wait `_START_CHECK_SECS=0.4` → if proc died, settle + retry, up to
`_START_RETRIES=3`).

**Layout** reordered to blocks: Listener (audio + meter) → Tuner → Presets.

**Audio-level meter (S-meter v1).** Appended `ebur128` to the ffmpeg filter
(needs `-loglevel info`); `_stderr_loop` parses momentary loudness `M: <LUFS>`
via `_EBUR128_M_RE`, maps [`_LUFS_FLOOR -60`, `_LUFS_CEIL -5`] → 0-100
(`self.audio_level`), exposed in status(), drawn as a gradient bar; panel polls
status at 1 Hz. Genuine errors filtered to `_last_error` only via `_ERROR_RE`
(so ebur128/info noise doesn't pollute the error display). CAVEAT: this is
POST-DEMOD AUDIO level (activity/modulation), **not calibrated RF dBm** — one
dongle held by rtl_fm can't give true RSSI. Calibration (`_LUFS_*`) landed right
first try; nudge if the bar pins or dies.

**SDR options evaluated, rtl_fm kept.** Inspected keenerd/rtlsdr-waterfall &
PLSDR (desktop GUI, waterfall CPU — rejected), pyrtlsdr (library, good for a
future IQ-based scope/S-meter but conflicts with rtl_fm on the one dongle),
rtl_fm_streamer (C fork: FM-stereo + retune-without-restart + GetPowerLevel, but
FM-ONLY so loses AM airband — rejected), SeanoNET/rtlsdr-radio (same
FastAPI+rtl_fm+ffmpeg arch as ours — validates design; borrowable: ICY "now
playing" metadata, and DAB+ via welle-cli). FUTURE ideas: RDS station name
(redsea), DAB+ mode (welle-cli, unlocks NPO Radio 5 which is DAB-only), true
IQ S-meter (pyrtlsdr, time-shared).

#### Display units default → metric (2026-07-05)
`frontend/js/meshpoint_display_units.js`: `DEFAULTS` and the load/save fallbacks
flipped to **Celsius + kilometers** (was fahrenheit/imperial). Browser-local
pref; explicit fahrenheit/imperial still honored, only unset browsers change.

#### Listener "real radio" UI + RDS + Web Audio VU (2026-07-05 late → live, working)
Big session turning the Listener tab into a proper radio face. All in
`frontend/js/listener_panel.js` + `frontend/css/listener.css` unless noted.

**Radio face.** Block order Listener → Tuner → Presets. Listener block = bezel
panel with: LED strip (mode badge `WFM/AM/NFM/USB/LSB` on the LEFT, then ON AIR
green + TUNING amber-blink LEDs), big cyan illuminated frequency (JetBrains
Mono, glow, **3 decimals** e.g. `98.000`), station line under it, segmented VU,
`<audio>` player. Bezel/glow/colors all from existing tokens (`--accent-*`,
`--glow-*`, `--font-mono`). Hint text removed. Native `title=` tooltips on
mode/ON AIR/TUNING/RDS/BLER/PTY (cursor:help).

**Presets** = data-driven `ListenerPanel.PRESET_GROUPS` (static getter),
grouped sections; delegated click sets freq+mode, marks active chip (lit cyan),
resets Level to default, tunes. Full precision preserved. Groups: Amsterdam FM
(WFM, Qmusic 100.4 / Sky 101.5 corrected), PMR446 16ch, Marine VHF, Marine UHF,
Schiphol airband AM (ACTUAL 8.33k carriers not channel labels), Ham & Utility.

**Level control.** ffmpeg `-af volume={v},alimiter=limit=0.9,ebur128`. Live
Level slider = PRE-encoder volume (clip fix must precede the MP3 encoder).
`DEFAULT_VOLUME=0.45`; resets to default on every preset switch.

**Clean switching + device-busy race fix** (`rtl_listener.py`): `_tune()` stops
old browser stream first; backend killpg reaps the shell before rtl_fm releases
libusb → "Failed to open rtlsdr device #0" → fixed with `_DEVICE_SETTLE_SECS`
(0.4) + `_start_locked_retrying()` (retry ≤3).

**RDS (WFM only, redsea).** RDS is on the 57 kHz MPX subcarrier, needs the WIDE
signal, and one dongle can't run two rtl_fm — so WFM switches to a **171 kHz MPX
pipeline teed to both redsea and ffmpeg** (needs `/bin/bash -c` for process
substitution):
`rtl_fm -M fm -s 171000 -F 9 | tee >(redsea -r 171000 -E > /tmp/meshpoint_rds.jsonl) | ffmpeg [MPX->audio]`.
ffmpeg reconstructs mono audio: `lowpass=f=15000,aemphasis=mode=reproduction:type=50fm,...`
(EU 50µs de-emphasis). `_rds_reader` tails the JSON file for `ps`/`radiotext`/
`prog_type`(PTY)/`bler`. **No `-p`** (partial) — only fully-received text, else
the marquee flickered on half-decoded fragments. status() exposes
`rds_ps/rds_rt/rds_pty/rds_bler`. Verified live on SLAM! 98.0 — audio + RDS both
worked first try (MPX rework needed no tuning). Other modes = unchanged narrow
pipeline, no RDS.

**Station line** (`_renderStation`): tags `[RDS][BLER %][PTY]` fixed on the left,
scrolling text to the right. **Marquee** only rebuilds when text CHANGES
(`_stationTextCache` guard) — rebuilding every poll was resetting it to frame 0
so it never scrolled. Prefers RDS PS (+RadioText when it differs from PS) over
preset label. `RDS`/`PTY`/`BLER` pills; BLER = `100 − block error rate`, colored
green≥90 / amber≥70 / red — the real signal-quality meter (RF), unlike the VU.
Station line + VU widened to `width:100%; max-width:720px` to match.

**VU meter = Web Audio (client-side), the important fix.** ebur128 audio_level
(400 ms integrated loudness) barely moved on compressed broadcast FM. Replaced
with a real-time `AnalyserNode` on the `<audio>` element: `_ensureAudioGraph()`
(element→analyser→destination, created ONCE — createMediaElementSource is
one-per-element), `_startVuLoop()` computes instantaneous RMS→dBFS→0-100 at
~60 fps (`(db+50)/47*100`, EMA smoothing). Peak-hold is time-based (~14 seg/s)
so it works at 60 fps or the 2 Hz poll fallback. Server `audio_level` kept only
as fallback (`_vuFromWebAudio` gate). Dances with the music, drops on quiet.

**24-hour time everywhere** (`hour12: false`): `simple_packet_feed.js`,
`meshtastic_panel.js`, `lorawan_panel.js`, `meshcore_panel.js`, `node_drawer.js`,
`node_metrics_chart.js`, `messaging_chat.js`, `messaging_contacts.js`,
`settings/update_panel_controller.js`. (Number `.toLocaleString()` counts left as-is.)

**Deploy note:** user pushes to the Pi themselves; needs `redsea` on PATH
(installed) for RDS. Tunable knobs if needed on-Pi: VU dB map `(db+50)/47`,
smoothing `0.4/0.6`, marquee speed `/22`, de-emphasis type, `_LUFS_*`. Verify
redsea JSON key is `bler` (`-E`) if the quality pill stays hidden.

**Still open (radio):** analog tuning dial (needle on band scale), DAB+ via
welle-cli (NPO Radio 5 is DAB-only), true-RF S-meter via pyrtlsdr (time-shared).
Evaluated & rejected: rtl_fm_streamer (FM-only, loses AM), PLSDR / rtlsdr-
waterfall (desktop GUI, waterfall CPU). rtlsdr-radio validated our arch +
suggested ICY metadata / DAB idea.

## What it does NOT do (intentional)

- LoRaWAN payloads NOT decrypted (need AppSKey/NwkSKey from the network)
- LoRaWAN NOT on the map (no position in LoRaWAN packets)
- LoRaWAN NOT relayed (ever)
- MeshCore NOT relayed (ever — listen only)
- Meshtastic 433 (Heltec V3 serial) packets handled by existing `serial` source —
  they decode and appear in dashboard like any Meshtastic packet

---

## Possible next steps

- Export LoRaWAN captures to CSV / TTN-compatible format
- Add EU433 LoRaWAN channel plan (`eu433_lorawan()`) — needs a 433 concentrator, not the M1
- Spectral scan overlay
- LoRaWAN MIC verification (cosmetic — tells you if a packet is malformed)
- Show 433 Meshtastic nodes separately in the UI (protocol + frequency tag)
