"""USB serial port classification by USB VID/PID.

Hardware-facts module shared by:
- ``src.capture.meshcore_usb_detect`` -- skip GPS sticks during MeshCore probing
- ``src.hal.location.factory`` (planned) -- locate GPS sticks for gpsd / uart

The classification table is intentionally small and conservative: only
hardware we have confirmed in the lab gets a known class. Everything else
falls through as ``UNKNOWN`` so existing behavior (probe-and-see) is
preserved.

Hardware confirmed (2026-05-30 on .141):

    0x1546:0x01a7  u-blox 7  (bare USB stick, VFAN puck) -- GPS_KNOWN
    0x1546:0x01a8  u-blox 8  (bare USB stick)            -- GPS_KNOWN
    0x10c4:0xea60  Silicon Labs CP210x (RAK Hotspot V2 SX1302 concentrator
                   AND Heltec V3 / V4 MeshCore companions)  -- AMBIGUOUS

The CP210x VID is shared between the on-board concentrator UART and the
ESP32-S3 MeshCore companion, so we do *not* pre-classify it. The existing
MeshCore handshake probe is the right disambiguator there.

    ``/dev/ttyUSBn``/``/dev/ttyACMn`` device path when neither symlink
    directory exists (e.g. developing on a Mac, or udev not configured).

    Trade-off worth documenting: by-path ties identity to the physical
    USB port, not the board itself -- moving a device to a different
